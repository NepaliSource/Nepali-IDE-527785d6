## 📖 Project Overview

**Nepali IDE (Code IDE)** is a sophisticated, AI-native mobile Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and code editor for Android, designed and developed by **Diwas Khatri**. It brings a desktop-class coding experience to your pocket — combining a full-featured code editor with syntax highlighting, an embedded Python interpreter, live HTML preview, an AI assistant powered by **Google Gemini**, and a complete project workspace with file versioning, Git integration, and local SQLite storage.

Built entirely with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, the app follows modern Android architecture with a clean MVVM pattern, Room persistence, coroutine-based concurrency, and Firebase GenAI integration. Whether you are a student, a competitive programmer, or a professional developer, Nepali IDE lets you prototype ideas, practice algorithms, and ship features — all without leaving your phone.

> **Made in Nepal, for developers everywhere.** Nepali IDE proves that world-class developer tools can be built locally — one line of Kotlin at a time.
